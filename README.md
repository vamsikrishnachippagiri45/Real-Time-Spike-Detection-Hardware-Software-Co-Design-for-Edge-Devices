# Real-Time-Spike-Detection-Hardware-Software-Co-Design-for-Edge-Devices
A lightweight hardware–software co-designed spike detector for real-time streaming sensor data. The design uses a running mean–based algorithm to detect abrupt anomalies caused by noise or transient faults. Implemented on an FPGA for low-latency, deterministic operation with low resource utilization, suitable for edge and embedded systems.


In recent years, edge computing has become important in many areas such as industrial automation and health monitoring. These systems depend on continuous streams of real-time sensor data to make critical decisions. Such data may often affected by abrupt spikes which are short-lived and irregular. These can lead to degraded system performance. Although Machine learning(ML) approches can detect such spikes, but they typically involve high resource utilization, high power consumption making them unsuitable for deployment on resource constrains edge platforms. Apart from machine learning, there are also traditional methods like Z-score, MAD (median absolute deviation), moving averages, and LMS filters used for detecting spikes in data. However many of these need complex calculations or have to store a lot of past data, which can slow things down or make them harder to run on simple hardware. 

To overcome these limitations, our work presents a lightweight spike detection strategy using a running mean approach that analyzes each incoming data point in real time, without relying on floating-point operations or large memory buffers. The design follows a hardware–software co-design model, where the main detection task is handled by a dedicated hardware unit, while a software layer takes care of control logic and data flow. This structure delivers a fast, power-efficient solution that is ideal for running in real-time on FPGAs at the edge.
